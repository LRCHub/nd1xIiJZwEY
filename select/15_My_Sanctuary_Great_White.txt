Sometimes I feel the blues all around me
And sometimes I feel like heartache's my only friend
Each time I pull this train off its tracks
It's getting harder so much harder to make it back

And when I feel alone
You've always been the one
Always been the one to share the load

You are my sanctuary
My mother Mary
And you're everything in life
Everything I want to be
Heaven made you for me

I wonder what you see in me my darling
I wonder what redeeming qualities
It seems like we've always been together
Through good time bad times you're still my rainbow's end

And when this old world's got me down
Trade a smile for a frown
Yeah you've always been the one who never let me down

You are my sanctuary
My mother Mary
And you're everything in life
Everything I want to be
Heaven made you for me
Made you for me

And when I'm feeling down and lonely
Your love keeps me alive
And so you know you know you're my one and only
From the heart I wrote down this song just for you

And when I feel alone
You've always been the one
Always been the one to share the load

You are my sanctuary
My mother Mary
And you're everything in life
Everything I want to be
Heaven made you for me

You are my sanctuary
You're my mother Mary
And you're everything in life
The only one my eyes can see
Heaven made you for me
Heaven made you for me
Heaven made just for me
Just for me
