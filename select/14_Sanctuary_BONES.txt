SESH
Blade on my waist
Blunt to the face and I'm up in this thang
Drugs in my veins, your bitch is so lame
Remember her throat, don't remember her name
Creep in the night, hear my knife from the flip
Taking your life then I'm taking your bitch
Feeding her drugs and watching her die
Kiss on her lips then I'm shutting her eyes
If she with BONES, she ain't leaving alive
Truthfully die, she was living a lie
Hated her folks, loved all the drugs
Hated true love, she just loves to fuck
Love just to gut, love just to roll
Hated just to talk, so she always moans
Riding all alone and I wish that I was home
Wishing that I didn't go down this road
The day that I die, hope my mama don't cry
Hope she realize it was just my time
Nobody ever ready to bury their own child
But I'm dead already, so I'm good for a while
Young white punk, dead girls rolling blunts
Blood on the Backwood, roll 'til she numb
Cuts on her wrists, teardrops on the face
So I flip my switchblade just to let her know she's safe
She just want BONES, I wanna be alone
I don't need friends, I don't need no home
I don't want money, I don't need a fuckin' car
Rather sleep in the alley, rather live with the bums
Young fucking scumbag, I don't know how
Bitches like me, but fuck it, it's alright
They hear how I rhyme, see how I act
They see my shows just to hear me rap
Baby, I could save you, come with me now
Take her to the grave then I put her in the ground
Hands on her neck, now she's saying, "Take my life"
Who am I to deny such a beautiful sight?
What? BONES
SESH, what?
Yeah, what?
Yeah, what?
What? What? What?
Oh, please don't go (What? What?)
Oh, please don't go (What? What?)
Don't leave me, don't leave me (SESH, SESH)
Don't leave, don't leave (SESH, SESH, SESH, SESH, SESH)
