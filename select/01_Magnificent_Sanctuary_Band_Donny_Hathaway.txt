Do you remember how it felt when you went to your first parade?
And how you saw that glorious marching band coming down the street?
Well try to imagine with me if you will that you were the first to see that band coming down the way
Growing bigger and bigger and your heart pounding harder and harder
It always seemed to me that my heart was in perfect time with the big bass drum
Do you remember how you got that glory feeling?
You feel it in your heart and in your mind and in your blood that some folks call religion

There are multitudes of people crying
Because they just won't see and try to understand
From the Book I read, not one but all must follow Him
Come and join the magnificent sanctuary band

There are multitudes of people dying
It seems like temptation rules over the Land
You know those people should remember His commandments
Come and join the magnificent sanctuary band

Singing in the band (singing in the band)
Talking to the Man (talking to the Man)
Bringing in the sheep all over the world just as fast as He can
Singing in the band (singing in the band)
Talking to the Man (talking to the Man)
Drop everything you're doing and join the sanctuary band

The Son of Man speaks of Revelations
He's reaching out, reaching out His hand
He has promised to bring us all salvation
Come and join the magnificent sanctuary band

Singing in the band (singing in the band)
Talking to the Man (talking to the Man)
Bringing in the sheep all over the world just as fast as He can
Singing (singing in the band)
Everybody talking (talking to the Man)
Drop everything you're doing and join the sanctuary band

Oh-whoa (two, three, four)
Singing in the band yeah (singing in the band)
Talking to the Man (talking to the Man)
Bringing in the sheep all over the world just as fast as He can
I'm singing (singing in the band)
Hey yeah (talking to the Man)
Drop everything you're doing and join the sanctuary band

You better c'mon (march for Jesus)
You better c'mon (march for the band)
Bringing in the sheep all over the world just as fast as He can
You better hurry (march for Jesus)
You better hurry (march for the band)
Drop everything you're doing and join the sanctuary band right now
