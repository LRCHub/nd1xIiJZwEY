A young man on a light black horse came
Riding through the wind and rain
Afraid of those who came behind
To try to take him back again

Seven times 'round put your ear to the ground
Can you hear the devil calling? All on your own
By the sanctuary stone
As the winter rain starts falling

For he had slain his own true love
The day before they were to wed, he's
Mounted on his big black steed
And left his lady lying dead

Seven times 'round put your ear to the ground
Can you hear the devil calling? All on your own
By the sanctuary stone
As the winter rain starts falling

He's rode all through the day and night
And rode again another day but still they follow
Close behind
That never he might ride away

Seven times 'round put your ear to the ground
Can you hear the devil calling? All on your own
By the sanctuary stone
As the winter rain starts falling

At last he's reached the sanctuary stone
Time to stop and rest a while so here's to you
My young men all
You'll never take me without trial

Seven times 'round put your ear to the ground
Can you hear the devil calling? All on your own
By the sanctuary stone
As the winter rain starts falling
